Project Overview: IoT Data Integration Solution
1. Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a robust IoT data integration solution that captures sensor data from a Raspberry Pi, processes it using AWS services, and stores the data efficiently for further analysis and access. The solution will utilize AWS IoT Core for secure data ingestion, AWS Lambda for data processing, DynamoDB for structured data storage, and S3 for unstructured data storage.

2. Architecture Overview
The architecture comprises several key components working together to ensure seamless data flow from the Raspberry Pi to AWS cloud services. The high-level architecture includes:

Raspberry Pi: Acts as the IoT device that collects and sends sensor data.
AWS IoT Core: Serves as the entry point for IoT data, providing secure communication between the Raspberry Pi and AWS cloud.
AWS Lambda: Processes the incoming data and interacts with DynamoDB and S3 for data storage.
DynamoDB: A NoSQL database that stores structured data for efficient querying and retrieval.
S3: A scalable object storage service used for storing raw JSON files and other unstructured data.
3. Components and Their Roles
Raspberry Pi

Role: Sensor data acquisition and transmission.
Functionality: Collects data such as temperature and humidity from sensors and publishes it to AWS IoT Core via MQTT protocol.
AWS IoT Core

Role: Data ingestion and initial processing.
Functionality: Provides secure communication channels, manages IoT devices, and routes messages to AWS Lambda functions based on defined rules.
AWS Lambda

Role: Data processing and integration.
Functionality: Executes serverless functions triggered by AWS IoT Core messages. Processes the incoming data and stores it in DynamoDB and S3.
DynamoDB

Role: Structured data storage.
Functionality: Stores time-series data and other structured information from the IoT devices. Facilitates fast and scalable data retrieval.
S3

Role: Unstructured data storage.
Functionality: Stores raw JSON data files for archival and retrieval. Supports large-scale storage with high durability and availability.
4. Workflow
Data Collection:

The Raspberry Pi collects sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity) and formats it into JSON messages.
Data Transmission:

The Raspberry Pi publishes the JSON messages to a specified MQTT topic on AWS IoT Core.
Data Ingestion:

AWS IoT Core receives the data and applies rules to route it to the appropriate AWS Lambda function.
Data Processing:

AWS Lambda is triggered by the incoming messages. It processes the data and performs two key actions:
Store Data: Inserts structured data into DynamoDB.
Upload Data: Stores raw JSON data files in an S3 bucket.
Data Storage:

The processed data is stored in DynamoDB for quick access and querying.
Raw data is stored in S3 for archival and potential future use.
5. Benefits
Scalability: The solution is scalable to accommodate increasing numbers of IoT devices and data volume.
Cost-Effective: Utilizes AWS serverless services (IoT Core, Lambda) that reduce infrastructure management and operational costs.
Security: Ensures secure data transmission using AWS IoT Core and encryption for data storage.
Flexibility: Allows easy integration of additional data processing steps or services as required.
Data Durability: S3 offers high durability for unstructured data, while DynamoDB provides fast access to structured data.
