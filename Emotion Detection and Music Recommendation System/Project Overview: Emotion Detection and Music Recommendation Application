Project Overview: Emotion Detection and Music Recommendation Application
1. Project Title:
Emotion Detection and Music Recommendation Application

2. Project Description:
The Emotion Detection and Music Recommendation Application is designed to enhance user experience by combining real-time emotion detection with personalized music recommendations. Leveraging a Raspberry Pi with a camera module, the application detects the user’s emotional state and provides tailored music suggestions to match their mood.

3. Objectives:
Real-Time Emotion Detection: Utilize computer vision to detect and analyze user emotions through facial expressions.
Personalized Music Recommendations: Fetch and suggest music tracks based on the detected emotion to improve the user’s mood.
Interactive User Interface: Create an engaging and intuitive UI/UX to display the camera feed, detected emotions, and music recommendations.
Integration with YouTube API: Access and display music recommendations from YouTube based on the detected emotional state.
4. Features:
Live Camera Feed: Display real-time video from the camera attached to the Raspberry Pi.
Emotion Analysis: Analyze facial expressions to detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, and more.
Music Recommendations: Fetch music recommendations from YouTube based on the detected emotion.
User Interface:
Home Screen: Shows the live camera feed, detected emotion, and a list of music recommendations.
Settings Screen: Allows users to input and save API keys and configure other settings.
Responsive Design: Adapt the UI for a 7-inch screen attached to the Raspberry Pi, ensuring usability and readability.
5. Technical Specifications:
Hardware:
Raspberry Pi with a 7-inch screen
Camera module compatible with the Raspberry Pi
Software:
Frontend: Flutter for building the mobile application UI.
Backend: Dart for programming logic and integration with external APIs.
Emotion Detection: OpenCV and pre-trained models for emotion recognition.
Music Recommendations: YouTube Data API for fetching music tracks based on emotions.
Data Handling:
Emotion Data: Processed in real-time to update the user interface.
Music Data: Retrieved from YouTube and displayed in the recommendations list.
